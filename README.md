# Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code ðŸ“š

> I just decide create this repo to keep the code examples from Martin Fowler' [Refactoring book](https://www.amazon.com.br/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0134757599) . I'm using my Skoob account to share about my daily reading, you can [follow my progress here](https://www.skoob.com.br/estante/livros/todos/6957331).
